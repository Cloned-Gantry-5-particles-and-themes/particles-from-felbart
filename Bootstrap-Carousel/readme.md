#Bootstrap Carousel is a slideshow component for cycling through elements, like a carousel. A slider is one of the best way of showcasing a huge amount of content within a small space on the web pages. 

I adapted the slider to work as a particle in Joomla Templates based on Gantry 5 Framework. It is easy to install. However, right now Gantry 5 doesnâ€™t offer the possibility of installing particles thought an installer, you need access to the server.

#Folder structure:

g5_hydrogen/custom/particles/carousel.html.twig

g5_hydrogen/custom/particles/carousel.yaml

g5_hydrogen/custom/js/carousel.js

g5_hydrogen/custom/scss/custom.scss  (copy the content of _carousel.scss)
